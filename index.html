<p>A <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/reading/2022/">report</a> released in October by the National Assessment of Educational Progress confirmed what many educators and parents suspected—children’s reading abilities declined during the pandemic.</p>

<p>For more than twenty years, national reading scores had been steadily improving, according to assessment data. But the latest report, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, showed that 43 states saw a drop in reading scores at the fourth-grade level from 2019 to 2022. The national average fell three points; a plunge not seen since 1998.</p>

<p>As the pandemic wears on and educators scramble to close learning gaps created by school and library closures, some states have more work to do than others. States like Virginia and Delaware experienced the most significant decreases, dropping a staggering 10 points from the previous assessment in 2019. New York fell six points.</p>

<p>Kanika Mobley, literacy specialist and program manager at Literacy Trust, said although she's not surprised, a decline in scores at this particular grade level is worrying. <a href="https://www.aecf.org/resources/early-warning-confirmed">Research shows</a> that reading proficiency by grade four is a critical indicator of future academic success.</p>

<p>Mobley attributes the national decline to a lack of reading resources available to children at home.</p>

<p>“It’s important for [parents] to keep books in the home that are compatible with their child’s reading level as well as books that align with their interests,” she said. "The more access kids have, the easier it is to rebuild those skills."</p>
